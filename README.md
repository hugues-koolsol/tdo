# tdo
A php/mysql skeleton without any framework or oop for back offices
Vanilla javascript, php and mysql, css and html.
*Why ?*
Frameworks evolve too much, they don't make evolutions but revolutions ! 
Revolutions happen most of the time when something is wrong and sometimes when something is new. 

A good and technically simple back office should be maintanable for at least 10 years
and I think that the components should be basic to allow this.

Tdo is not full of shiny interfaces, super-clever components and delightfull buzzwords but anyone with a reasonable knoweledge in the 5 basic technologies used in web development is able to maintain it. These techlogies are : server language (php) , database ( mysql ), html, javascript and css

Tdo contains a menu "generate sources" to produce basic filtered list+CRUD interfaces when the database fields are defined.
Then, you only have to maintain theses sources.

If your client really wants shiny, use angular, react, zend, symfony, laravel ... and make him pay ! You have many choises, and these many choises is the very begining of not-yours but others difficulties for maintenance :-)
