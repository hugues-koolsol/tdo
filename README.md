# tdo
A php/mysql skeleton without any framework or oop for back offices
Vanilla javascript, php and mysql, css anf html.
*Why ?*
Frameworks evolve too much, they don't make make evolutions but revolutions ! 
Revolutions happen most of the time when something is wrong and sometimes when something is new. 

A good and technically simple back office should be maintanable for at least 10 years
and I think that the components should be basic to allow this.

Tdo is not full of shiny interfaces, super-clever components and delightfull buzzwords but anyone with a reasonable knoweledge in the 5 basic technologies used in web development is able to maintain it. these techlogies are : server language (php) , database ( mysql ), html, javascript and css ) 

If your client really wants this, use angular, react, zend, symfony, laravel ... and make him pay ! You have many choises, and these many choises is the very begining of your difficulties :-)
